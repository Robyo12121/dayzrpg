# dayzrpg
A text based RPG, written in Python, based in the Dayz universe. 

1. What this project does:
This is a text adventure game, written in Python 3, based in the Dayz universe.
Dayz is a mod for the Bohemia Interactive game Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead which has since become a standalone game.
The goal of this project is to improve my understanding of programming, python, game design, object oriented programming as 
well as to have fun. I want the game to simulate the dayz experience and functionality as close as is possible in a text-based game.
Features such as: permanent death, looting, zombies, shooting, surviving, crafting etc.

Another goal of this project is to extend this text game into a MUD style multiplayer game, which may or may not require
a massive re-write. But that is way, way down the road.

I might possibly try to build it on the Evenia platform. Who knows? I certainly don't
